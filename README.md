Decoder for the binary XML format used by Android.

This library implements the minimal amount of parsing required obtain
useful information from a binary `AndroidManifest.xml`. It does not
support parsing generic binary XML documents and does not have
support for decoding resource identifiers. In return, the compiled
footprint of the library is _much_ lighter as it does not have to
link in Android's `resources.arsc` file.

For a full-featured Rust binary XML parser,
[abxml-rs](https://github.com/SUPERAndroidAnalyzer/abxml-rs)
is highly recommended if it is acceptable to link a 30MB `resources.arsc`
file into your compiled binary.

The following features will be implemented in the future:
* Support for binary XML documents using UTF-8 encoding for the string pool
* Support for binary XML documents with UTF-16 strings longer than 32767
characters

Please file an issue with the relevant binary `AndroidManifest.xml` if
if any issues are encountered.
